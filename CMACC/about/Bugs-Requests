Bugs / Requests for Improvements:


1.  Figure out the "oddity" in the building of the Dictionary. See the note on Expansion-of-a-List.

2. Trim the <ol><li>  - </li></ol>  - explained in the note on Expansion-of-a-List.

3.  Provide an output of the expanded List (the Dictionary).

4.  ROLL-Back - to be considered in the future.  Enforce a two-linebreak rule between key/values.  This allows the author to use line breaks to make the value easier to read.  Also makes it easier to spot the key. 

5.  Handle infinite loops.  I can't figure out how I created one, but I did. Iâ€™ll see if it happens again. 

6. An expression that ends in a dollar sign is not evaluated {Price.Max.$}.
